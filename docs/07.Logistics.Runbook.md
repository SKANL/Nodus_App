# 07. Logistics: Event Runbook

> **Status:** Draft
> **Audience:** Event Organizers / Tech Lead

## 1. Hardware Checklist (The Survival Kit)

### The Command Center

- [ ] **1x Windows Laptop:** Core i7, 16GB RAM minimum.
- [ ] **1x USB Bluetooth Dongle:** Baseus or TP-Link (Bluetooth 5.0+). Do NOT rely on internal chipsets.
- [ ] **1x UPS (No-Break):** The server MUST NOT lose power.
- [ ] **1x Wi-Fi Router:** For the Laptop's local network (even without internet).

### The Bridges (Optional but Recommended)

- [ ] **4x High-End Android Phones:** Pixel 6 or Galaxy S21+.
- [ ] **4x Power Banks:** To keep bridges alive for 8 hours.
- [ ] **Mounts:** Tripods to place bridges 2 meters above ground (above head height).

## 2. Software Installation (The Headache)

_Constraint:_ There is no Internet. We cannot use the App Store on the day.

### Android

- **Method:** Sideloading via USB OTG.
- **Prep:** Have the `.apk` file on 5 USB drives (USB-C).
- **Process:** Plug -> Install -> Warn about "Unknown Sources" -> Accept.

### iOS (The Danger Zone)

- **Method:** TestFlight Public Link (Must happen 24h before).
- **Pre-Event:** Email all judges the TestFlight link. They MUST install at home.
- **On-Site:** If they didn't install it, **THEY CANNOT BE JUDGES**. Have backup Android tablets ready for them.

## 3. Disaster Recovery

### Scenario A: Server Laptop Crashes/Updates

1.  **Don't Panic:** The Judges' phones have the "Source of Truth" in their SQLite `Pending` rows.
2.  **Restart:** Reboot Laptop -> Open Nodus Server.
3.  **Recover:** The Server DB might be empty/corrupt?
    - _Action:_ Restore from last backup (auto-backup every 5 mins).
    - _Resync:_ Judges' phones will see the server reappear and re-transmit everything. **No data is lost.**

### Scenario B: 2.4GHz jam (Microwaves/Too many people)

1.  **Pivot:** Switch to "Mule Mode".
2.  **Instruction:** Announce on PA: "Judges, please come to the Command Table to sync your votes manually."
3.  **Action:** Judges walk to within 1 meter of the Server Dongle. Physics wins.
