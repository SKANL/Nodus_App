# 06. UX: User Flows & Optimistic UI

> **Status:** Draft
> **Key Principle:** "Don't Make Me Wait"

## 1. The "Optimistic" Philosophy

In Nodus, network latency can be 5 seconds or 5 hours. The UI **must never block** the user while waiting for a connection.

- **Wrong:** User taps "Submit" -> Spinner appears -> Waits 10s -> "Error".
- **Right:** User taps "Submit" -> Animation plays -> Form closes -> "Saved!" toast appears.

## 2. Visual Feedback States (The Traffic Light)

We use a persistent **Status Indicator** in the TopAppBar.

| Icon | Color | State       | Meaning                                                      |
| :--- | :---- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ☁️   | Green | **Synced**  | All votes are on the Server/Cloud.                           |
| 💾   | Amber | **Pending** | Votes are safely saved on the Phone, waiting for connection. |
| ⚠️   | Red   | **Risk**    | Storage full or Bluetooth radio disabled.                    |

## 3. Core User Flows

### A. The "Join Event" Flow (Onboarding)

1.  **Start:** User opens App (First Run).
2.  **Scan:** Large button "Scan Event QR".
3.  **Action:** Camera opens -> Scans Code.
4.  **Feedback:**
    - _Immediate:_ Haptic buzz.
    - _Screen:_ "Welcome to Hackathon 2026".
    - _Background:_ App saves Keys + Server UUIDs.

### B. The "Voting" Flow (The Happy Path)

1.  **Trigger:** Judge scans a Project QR (e.g., "Team Alpha").
2.  **Load:** App loads schematic from Local SQLite (Instant).
3.  **Input:** Judge manipulates Sliders (1-10) and types comment.
4.  **Submit:**
    - Judge taps "Send Vote".
    - UI: Button turns Green with Checkmark.
    - Navigation: Popped back to Scanner immediately.
    - _Logic:_ Vote inserted to SQLite. Background Worker wakes up.

### C. The "Swarm" Feedback (Invisible)

The user **never** sees "Connecting to Bridge Node...". Use vague but reassuring language.

- _Notification:_ "Sending votes via nearby mesh..." (If stuck in Amber state for > 5 mins).

## 4. Error Handling

- **Duplicate Scan:** If Judge scans "Team Alpha" again -> Show "Edit Vote" screen, not a new blank form.
- **Bluetooth Off:** Aggressive Alert. "Nodus requires Bluetooth. Enable now?"
